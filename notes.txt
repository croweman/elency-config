app environment

- allow/dissalow inheritance
- specify teams
- or apps

when removing inheritance error if there are already apps inheriting, or any configurations already inheriting should continue?
when editing can you remove inheritance on app configuration if in use?

app allow to pick anything that allows inheiritance
what to do if no longer allows inheritance?

specify latest or specific?

actually have index creation script and update readme to reference it

verify when saving that you can inherit things chosen

MESSAGING - WHEN SAVING INHERITED CONFIG TO INFORM EDITOR YOU COULD IMPACT APPLICATIONS?

YOU CANT INHERIT YOURSELF
BASE MUST BE INCLUDED IN COMPARE!!!!
What if you delete a config, should there be verification somehow if something else using it
